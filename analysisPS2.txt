Analysis of Program

** (.) for multiplication

0) def readActMovfile(self, inputfile):

Analysis : Complexity of reading file containing n lines is n as we need to iterate n times
            Iterating through each line actors is a

            Complexity is n.a as a is very minimal
            O(n)

1) def displayActMov(self):

Analysis : There are two for loops for movie and actor.
           Iteration over unique movies  m and Iteration over unique actor A


            Complexity is m+a
            We know,no of movies equal to no of lines n i.e m=n
            A is no of actors a1+a2+a3+.......+an
            a1 no of actors in line 1
            a2 no of actors in line 2
            a3 no of actors in line 3

            =n+a1+a2+a3+....+an
            =n+kn (k is atmost 2)
            =n(2+1)
            =3n
            =O(n)

 2) def displayActorsOfMovie(self, movie):

 Analysis : To get index of movie in ActMov list is O(n)
            Iterate through movie is m
            We know,no of movies equal to no of lines n i.e m=n

            Complexity is n+n
            =n(1+1)
            =2n
            =O(n)

3) def displayMoviesOfActor(self, actor):

Analysis : To get index of actor in ActMov list is O(n)
            Iterate through actor is A
            From previous method ,we found out A=kn

            Complexity is n+kn
            =n(k+1)
            =O(n)

4) def findMovieRelation(self, movA, movB):

Analysis : Initially it calls method to find actors of movA
            Complexity is O(n) as we need to iterate over movies
            Complexity list[index] is O(1)

            Complexity to find actors of movA is O(n)
            Complexity to find actors of movB is O(n)
            Iteration for common actor is k
            Complexity is O(n)+O(n)
            =n+n+k
            =2n+k (k=2 as given in problem statement)
            =2n+2
            =2(n+1)
            =n
            =O(n)

5) def findMovieTransRelation(self, movA, movB):

Analysis : Initially it iterates over unique movies list
            From previous method, complexity is O(n)

            Complexity to find common actors between movA and movC are O(n)
            Complexity to find common actors between movB and movC are O(n)

            Complexity =n(n+n)
            =n(2n)
            =2n^2
            =O(n^2)
